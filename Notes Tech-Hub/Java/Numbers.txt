1. Natural Numbers
Definition: Positive integers starting from 1 (or sometimes 0, depending on the context).
Examples: 1,2,3,4,…

2. Whole Numbers
Definition: Non-negative integers, including zero.
Examples: 0,1,2,3,4,…

3. Integers
Definition: All whole numbers and their negatives.
Examples: −3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3

4. Even Numbers
Definition: Integers divisible by 2 without a remainder.
Examples: −4,0,2,4,6

5. Odd Numbers
Definition: Integers not divisible by 2.
Examples: −3,1,3,5,7

6. Prime Numbers
Definition: Natural numbers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves.
Examples: 2,3,5,7,11

7. Composite Numbers
Definition: Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime.
Examples: 4,6,8,9,12

8. Perfect Numbers
Definition: Positive integers that are equal to the sum of their proper divisors (excluding themselves).
Examples: 6(1+2+3),28(1+2+4+7+14)

9. Palindromic Numbers
Definition: Numbers that read the same backward as forward.
Examples: 121,454,12321

10. Fibonacci Numbers
Definition: Numbers in a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Examples: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8

11. Triangular Numbers
Definition: Numbers that can form an equilateral triangle when arranged as dots.
Examples: 1,3,6,10 (e.g., 1,1+2,1+2+3)

12. Square Numbers
Definition: Numbers that are squares of integers.
Examples: 1,4,9,16,25

13. Cube Numbers
Definition: Numbers that are cubes of integers.
Examples: 1,8,27,64,125

14. Negative Numbers
Definition: Numbers less than zero.
Examples: −1,−2,−5

15. Positive Numbers
Definition: Numbers greater than zero.
Examples: 1,2,3

16. Perfect Squares
Definition: Same as square numbers; integers that are squares of whole numbers.
Examples: 1,4,9,16,25

17. Kaprekar Numbers
Definition: A number whose square can be split into two parts that add up to the original number.
Examples: 45 (45^2 = 2025; 20 + 25 = 45), 55,99

18. Armstrong Numbers (or Narcissistic Numbers)
Definition: Numbers equal to the sum of their own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
Examples: 153(1^3+5^3+3^3 =153),9474

19. Harshad Numbers
Definition: Numbers divisible by the sum of their digits.
Examples: 18,21,27

20. Strong Number
Definition: A number is called a Strong Number if the sum of the factorials of its digits is equal to the number itself.
Example: 145(1!=1, 4!=24, 5!=120), 2, 40585

21. Duck Number
Definition: A Duck Number is a number that contains at least one zero in its digits but the zero(s) cannot be at the beginning of the number.
It can be represented in any positional numeral system but is commonly checked in base-10.
Example: 3210,105,5023
Contains a zero, and the zero is not at the start.

22. Happy Number
Definition: A Happy Number is a number that eventually reduces to 1 when replaced repeatedly by the sum of the squares of its digits.
If this process results in an endless cycle of numbers that does not include 1, the number is called an Unhappy (or Sad) Number.
Example: Start with 19
19 =1^2+9^2=82

Replace with 82
82 =6^2+2^2=68

Replace with 68
68 = 6^2+8^2=100

Replace with 100
100 = 1^2+0^2+0^2=1

Since the process ends at 1, 9 is a Happy Number.
