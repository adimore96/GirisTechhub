1. What are the main elements of a table in HTML, and how do they work together?

The main elements of a table in HTML include:
<table>: The container for the table.
<thead>: The header section of the table, containing column titles.
<tbody>: The body section, which contains the actual data of the table.
<tr>: Table rows, which group a set of table cells.
<th>: Table header cells, usually bold and centered, representing column headings.
<td>: Table data cells, which hold the data for each row.
Together, these elements define the structure and organization of tabular data.

2. How do colspan and rowspan attributes work in tables?

The colspan attribute allows a cell to span multiple columns, combining those columns into one cell horizontally. For example, a cell with colspan="2" will take up the space of two columns.
The rowspan attribute allows a cell to span multiple rows, merging those rows into one cell vertically. For example, a cell with rowspan="2" will take up the space of two rows.

3. What do text-align and vertical-align attributes do in a table cell?

The text-align attribute in a table cell (e.g., td or th) specifies the horizontal alignment of the text within the cell. Common values include left, right, and center.
The vertical-align attribute determines the vertical alignment of the text within a cell. Common values include top, middle, and bottom. This attribute is particularly useful when working with cells that contain images or varying heights of content
