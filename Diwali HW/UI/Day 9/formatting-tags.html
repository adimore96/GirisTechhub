    <h1>Reading: A Journey of Imagination</h1>

    <p><strong>Reading</strong> has always been one of my favorite hobbies. It allows me to explore new worlds, <em>dive into different cultures</em>, and learn about various subjects. Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, books <mark>ignite my imagination</mark> and help me see life from different perspectives.</p>

    <h2>Why I Love Reading</h2>

    <p>One of the <u>main reasons</u> I enjoy reading is because it is a <strong>form of escape</strong>. When I read a novel, I feel like I am transported to another place and time. I particularly enjoy books that <em>challenge my thinking</em> and make me question what I know. It's a great way to <u>relax</u> after a busy day.</p>

    <h3>Genres I Prefer</h3>

    <p>While I enjoy all types of books, my favorite genres are <mark>mystery</mark> and <u>science fiction</u>. I love the suspense that comes with mystery novels, and the futuristic ideas in science fiction always <em>captivate my imagination</em>. I also like reading self-improvement books because they provide <strong>valuable insights</strong> for personal growth.</p>

    <p><small>Note: I usually read at least one book every week, depending on my schedule.</small></p>
