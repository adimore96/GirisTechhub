1. What is the purpose of the <strong> and <em> tags, and how do they differ from using bold and italic styles in CSS?
<strong>: Indicates important text, usually displayed in bold.
<em>: Emphasizes text, usually displayed in italic.
Difference: These tags add meaning (importance or emphasis) to the text, while CSS styles (like font-weight: bold; or font-style: italic;) only change appearance without adding semantic value.

2. What effect does using the <mark> tag have on text, and when would you typically use it?
Effect: The <mark> tag highlights text, usually with a yellow background.
Use: Typically used to highlight important or relevant text, such as key points or search results.
