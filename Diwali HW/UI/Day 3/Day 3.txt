Day 3

1. What is the difference between block, inline, and inline-block elements in HTML?

Block elements take up the full width and start on a new line. Inline elements take only as much width as needed and do not start on a new line. Inline-block elements can sit next to each other and allow width and height to be set.
How does the display: inline-block property work?

The display: inline-block; property allows an element to sit inline with other elements while still letting you set its width and height.
Explain a scenario where you would use inline-block.

You would use inline-block in a navigation menu to have menu items sit next to each other while allowing control over their size.

2. What happens when you change the display property of an inline element to block or a block element to inline?

Changing an inline element to display: block; makes it start on a new line and take full width. Changing a block element to display: inline; makes it take only the width it needs.

3. Describe a real-world example where changing the display type would be useful.

A real-world example is a grid of images on a website. If images are in <div> elements as block elements, they will stack vertically. Changing them to display: inline-block; allows them to sit next to each other, making better use of space.
